# kvd

A key-value config diffing tool for structured files like TOML, JSON, and YAML.

This is the CLI frontend for the `kvd` config diffing tool. If you're looking to
use this functionality in Rust, see the
[`kvd-delta`](https://crates.io/crates/kvd-delta) library.

**Note**: The CLI is under development and may change.
